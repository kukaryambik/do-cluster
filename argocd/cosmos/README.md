What could be improved:

1. TO LEARN HOW IT WORKS! I still don't really understand what I've done, and I don't like this feeling.
2. Describe all this manifests as a Helm chart for convenience and flexibility.

4. Configure built-in metrics.
5. Add alerting.
6. Create a custom image build for security.
